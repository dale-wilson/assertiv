Assertiv
========

Minimal C++ header-only unit test framework from [OCI](http://ociweb.com)

Assertiv is a header-only unit test framework.  It is designed to be embedded within your own open-source project, rather than having a separate project for your clients to download and build.

Just include it in your project, set up the build environment, and test.

There are no more excuses.

## Features
* Header-only - no library to build
* Output file, line number and failiure conditions
* Summarizes count of total and failing test cases and assertions.
